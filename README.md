# Sidemen Clothing Clone

### Project Overview 📋

The Sidemen Clothing Clone is a full-stack e-commerce application designed to replicate the functionality of a real-world online store. This project provides a realistic and interactive shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, create accounts, manage shopping carts, and proceed through a simulated checkout process. While the application is still under development (approximately 30% complete), the frontend-backend-database communication is fully operational, forming a solid foundation for the implementation of additional features.

### Purpose 🎯

I picked this project because of its breadth and depth. It’s highly applicable in the real world, providing a benchmark that allows me to work with a level of detail similar to professionals. This project will help deepen my understanding of full-stack development by covering a wide range of topics, including front-end design, back-end API development, database management, user authentication, developing search algorithms, and more. Progress has been slow as I've emphasized learning and building a detailed Note Stack.

### Key Features 🔑:

### Design & UI/UX 🎨

Although this project is a clone, the UI/UX design was crafted by me. The design draws heavy inspiration from Sidemen Clothing, but also incorporates elements from other major brands such as Nike, Adidas, Amazon, and Ralph Lauren.
