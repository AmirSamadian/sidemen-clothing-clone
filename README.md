# Sidemen Clothing Clone

### Project Overview ðŸ“‹

The Sidemen Clothing Clone is a full-stack e-commerce application designed to replicate the functionality of a real-world online store. This project provides a realistic and interactive shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, create accounts, manage shopping carts, and proceed through a simulated checkout process. While the application is still under development (approximately 35% complete), the frontend-backend-database communication is fully operational, forming a solid foundation for the implementation of additional features.
